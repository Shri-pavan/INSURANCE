# Insurance Data Analysis

This repository presents an end-to-end data analysis project on an insurance dataset using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**. It explores key factors such as charges, age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region in relation to insurance costs.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `insurance.csv`  
  Raw dataset with details like age, gender, BMI, smoker status, number of children, and insurance charges.

- `Insurance.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter Notebook that performs:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
  - Correlation and trend insights

## 📊 Key Features

- Statistical summaries of variables
- Visualization of insurance charges across demographics
- Analysis of how smoking and BMI impact insurance cost
